= Requirements =
   * QuickBooks Point Of Sale
   * Zen Cart online shopping cart configured with a mysql database http://www.zen-cart.com/
   * Excel
   * I recomend using dropbox to store the exported file on http://www.dropbox.com/

= Setup Steps =
   * decide where the script will run.
      * it can run on any windows computer.
      * It will need to access the "items" file exported from quickbooks.
      * I run it as a scheduled Task every 10 minutes
   * gather your database credentials
      * username - of a user with privileges to update the data
      * password
      * database name
      * database server FQDN name

== configuring the program == 
   * edit the file "qb2zenImport.exe.config" changing the values to be valid for your situation.
{{{
<add key="LogPath" value="C:\PATH\TO\LOG\FILES\" />
<add key ="ItemsFile" value ="C:\PATH\TO\ECPORTED\INVENTORY\FILE\QB POS Inventory Items Export.xls"/>
<add key ="ArchivePath" value ="c:\PATH\TO\ARCHIVE\OLD\INFO\"/>
<add key="zcServer" value="FQDN_ZENCART_DATABASE_SERVER_NAME"/>
<add key="zcUser" value="ZENCART_USERNAME"/>
<add key="zcPassword" value="ZENCART_PASSWORD"/>
<add key="zcDatabase" value="ZENCART_DATABASE_NAME"/>
}}}
      * I usually make the log path and the archive path the same location.
      * If you're running the script on a computer that is not the point of sale computer, you should use Dropbox as the destination of the export and also as the path included in the "ItemsFile" value.



== exporting from quickbooks ==
   * Read here [ExportingFromQBPOS] 


= What output to expect = 
   * The program produces two files of output
      * {{{<datetimestamp>}}}NotOnline.csv
         * This contains a listing of all items which are in the export file but were not found online. You can use this to know which items to your online cart 
      * {{{<datetimestamp>}}}Online.csv
         * This file contains all of the items that were found in the online cart, and whether or not the quantities were updated.
   * The program also moves the ItemsFile from it's original location into the Archve path, and also changes it's name to be a datetimestamp only.
